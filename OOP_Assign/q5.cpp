/*Q2. Write a C++ program to check if two strings S1 and S2 are rotations of each other.
For example all possible rotated strings of ”ABCD” are “BCDA”, “CDAB”, and “DABC”
Sample test case 1: Input: S1 = “ABCD” and S2 = “CDAB”
Output: TRUE
Sample test case 2: Input: S1 = “ABCD” and S2 = “ACBD”
Output: FALSE*/
