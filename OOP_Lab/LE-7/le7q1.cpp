/*1. Consider an example of declaring the examination result. Design three classes: Student, Exam, 
and Result. The Student class has data members representing roll number, name. Create the class Exam 
by inheriting Student class. The Exam class adds fields (data members) representing the marks scored 
in six subjects. Derive the Result from the Exam class, and it has its own fields such as total_marks. 
Write an interactive program to model this relationship.*/
