/*6. Create a class named Shirt that has the public data members collarsize and sleeveLength. Create a class named Pants that has the public data members waistSize
 and inSeam. Write a program that declares one object of each type Shirt and Pants and assigns values to the objectsï¿½ data fields.  Write two overloaded functions 
 named displayClothingFacts(). One version of the function takes a Shirt object as an argument; the other version takes a Pants object. Each version displays the 
 facts about the piece of clothing. Your main() function should demonstrate that you can call displayClothingFacts() with either type of clothing.*/
